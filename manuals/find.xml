	<description>This  manual  page documents the GNU version of find.  GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given
expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand  side  is  false
for and operations, true for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.</description>
