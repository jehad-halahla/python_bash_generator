	<command>lscpu</command>
	<description>lscpu gathers CPU architecture information from sysfs, /proc/cpuinfo and any applicable architecture-specific libraries (e.g. librtas on Powerpc). The
command output can be optimized for parsing or for easy readability by humans. The information includes, for example, the number of CPUs, threads,
cores, sockets, and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes. There is also information about the CPU caches and cache sharing, family, model, bogoMIPS,
byte order, and stepping.</description>
